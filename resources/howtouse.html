<h2><a id="localstorage" name="localstorage">Local Storage</a><a href="#howtouse"><sup>&#8679;</sup></a></h2>

<p>When selecting &quot;Save&quot; in the Options Screen or in the Data Set Management Screen, the Team or Data Set data will be saved to local memory.</p>

<p>This data will remain until either</p>

<ul>
	<li>the application files are moved or</li>
	<li>the browser&#39;s cache is cleared.</li>
</ul>

<p>While data will remain here for extended periods of time, it is not advisable to only rely on this. This memory should be considered <strong>temporary</strong>!</p>

<p>For permanent storage, please <a href="#exportimport">Export</a> the data and manually save the resulting text to a file.</p>

<p><a id="storagenotes" name="storagenotes">Please note that:</a></p>

<ul>
	<li>Each browser keeps a separate cache, so, for example, data made in Internet Explorer will be unavailable to Google Chrome without Exporting and Importing.</li>
	<li>It is impossible for this application to save a file to a user&#39;s computer. This is by design for security reasons. Therefore, manually exporting and importing data is the only way to permanently save the application&#39;s data.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="exportimport" name="exportimport">Exporting / Importing Data</a><a href="#howtouse"><sup>&#8679;</sup></a></h2>

<p>As previously explained in <a href="#storagenotes">Local Storage</a>, the only method of permanently saving data is to manually Export it and Import it using the following method.</p>

<p>To view the Export and Import Screens, select either &quot;Export&quot; or &quot;Import&quot; from the left pane of the Options Screen.</p>

<p>To Export all data:</p>

<ul>
	<li>From the Export Screen, select &quot;Export Data&quot; in the top right area of the screen,</li>
	<li>copy the text that appears below the button, and</li>
	<li>save that data in a file of your choice (e.g. Microsoft Word, Notepad, Word Pad, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>To Import data:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Copy the previously exported data text,</li>
	<li>paste that into the text area below the &quot;Import Data&quot; button on the Import Screen, and</li>
	<li>select &quot;Import Data&quot;.</li>
</ul>

<p>If all data has been successfully imported, it will be shown on the Options Screen and the Data Set Management Screen.</p>

<p>Please note that:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Existing data and imported data will be merged together.</li>
	<li>If a name conflict occurs between existing data and imported data, the imported data will not overwrite the existing data.</li>
</ul>
