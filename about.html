<h1><a id="whatis" name="whatis">What is Jeopardy?</a><a href="#about"><sup>&#8679;</sup></a></h1>

<p>Jeopardy is a popular quiz-style game show in the United States. The game is typically played with three contestants who compete for the highest score by betting points on quiz questions. The general flow of the game is as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>One player (usually the previous winner) is chosen and given &quot;control&quot; of the game board. That player chooses a question by category and value (e.g. &quot;Days of the Week for 80 points&quot;).</li>
	<li>After the host has completely read the question, any player can answer the question.
	<ul>
		<li>Players to answer the question are chosen by speed, for example, the first to raise their hand or the first to ring their game buzzer (if available).</li>
		<li>If they answer the question correctly, they are awarded the alotted number of points.</li>
		<li>If they guess incorrectly, they lose those points (negative scores are allowed), and another player may choose to answer the question.</li>
		<li>No player is forced to answer. When the question is answered correctly, or no player wishes to answer, then the correct answer is given, and the question is closed.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The player who correctly answers the question is given control of the board and may choose the next question.
	<ul>
		<li>If no correct answer was given on the previous question, control of the board remains with the player who chose that question.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Gameplay continues in this style until all questions have been answered.</p>
